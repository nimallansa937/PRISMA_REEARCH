      "abstract": "This paper investigates systemic tail dependence within the crypto-asset ecosystem by examining interconnectedness across eight major tokens spanning Layer 1 cryptocurrencies, DeFi tokens, stablecoins, and infrastructure/governance assets. We employ a novel partial correlation-based network framework and quantile-specific connectedness measures to examine how co-movement patterns evolve under normal and extreme market conditions from September 2021 to March 2025. Unlike conventional correlation or variance decomposition approaches, our methodology isolates direct, tail-specific transmission channels while filtering out standard shocks. The results indicate strong asymmetries in dependence structures. Systemic risk intensifies during adverse tail events, particularly around episodes such as the Terra/Luna crash, the USDC depeg, and Bitcoin’s 2024 halving cycle. Our analysis shows that ETH, LINK, and UNI are key assets in spreading losses when the market falls. In contrast, the stablecoin DAI tends to absorb some of the stress, helping reduce risk during downturns. These results indicate critical contagion pathways and suggest that regulation targeting protocol-level transparency, liquidity provisioning, and interoperability standards may reduce amplification mechanisms without eliminating interdependence. Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on crypto-systemic risk and offer actionable insights for regulators, DeFi protocol architects, and institutional investors. In particular, we advocate for the incorporation of tail-sensitive network diagnostics into real-time monitoring frameworks to better manage asymmetric spillover risks in decentralized financial systems.",

      "abstract": "In the Proof of Stake (PoS) Ethereum ecosystem, users can stake ETH on Lido to receive stETH, a Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) that represents staked ETH and accrues staking rewards. LSDs improve the liquidity of staked assets by facilitating their use in secondary markets, such as for collateralized borrowing on Aave or asset exchanges on Curve. The composability of Lido, Aave, and Curve enables an emerging strategy known as leverage staking, an iterative process that enhances financial returns while introducing potential risks. This paper establishes a formal framework for stETH leverage staking and identifies 442 such positions on Ethereum over 963 days. These positions represent a total volume of 537,123 ETH (877m USD). Our data reveal that 81.7% of leverage staking positions have achieved an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) higher than conventional staking on Lido. Despite the high returns, we also recognize the potential risks. For example, the Terra crash incident demonstrated that token devaluation can impact the market. Therefore, we conduct stress tests under extreme conditions of significant stETH devaluation to evaluate the associated risks. Our simulations reveal that leverage staking amplifies the risk of cascading liquidations by triggering intensified selling pressure through liquidation and deleveraging processes. Furthermore, this dynamic not only accelerates the decline of stETH prices but also propagates a contagion effect, endangering the stability of both leveraged and ordinary positions.",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolution of decentralized financial (DeFi) ecosystems has introduced unprecedented flexibility, transparency, and user control in global capital markets. However, this decentralization also introduces considerable systemic vulnerabilities, including fragmented data landscapes, unregulated liquidity flows, and an increased surface area for fraud, volatility, and contagion effects. Traditional risk assessment frameworks, built for centralized and structured financial environments, lack the adaptability and responsiveness required to capture these nonlinear, rapidly shifting risk factors in real time. This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly advanced machine learning and graph-based inference techniques, can be leveraged to integrate diverse, unstructured datasets from blockchain ledgers, smart contracts, market oracles, and social media to construct comprehensive and predictive risk assessment models for DeFi environments. We propose an AI-driven data integration framework that combines entity recognition, transactional pattern mining, and sentiment-weighted event analysis to model user behavior, asset interdependencies, and protocol vulnerabilities. Emphasis is placed on anomaly detection for early warning signals of flash loan attacks, liquidity drain risks, and cascading failures across interconnected DeFi protocols. Case studies are used to demonstrate the system’s applicability to real-world DeFi incidents, such as stablecoin de-pegging events and governance manipulation. The results highlight the framework's effectiveness in reducing response latency, improving capital resilience, and enhancing portfolio risk transparency for developers, auditors, and institutional investors. Furthermore, this approach fosters proactive regulatory insight by mapping systemic risks without compromising the decentralized ethos. By fusing AI with decentralized data architectures, this work contributes a novel paradigm for safeguarding the integrity and sustainability of next-generation financial infrastructures.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has given rise to flash loan, a type of uncollateralized loan service that enables users to easily borrow substantial amounts of funds. However, this has prompted attackers to conduct malicious arbitrage within DeFi protocols, known as notorious flash loan attacks, resulting in significant asset losses. Existing works primarily focus on investigating price oracle manipulation, a common tactic in flash loan attacks, but lack a comprehensive understanding regarding the entire process of flash loan attacks and the diverse range of attack methods. In this paper, we empirically study 155 real-world flash loan attack incidents, representing the largest-scale study to date. We first categorize these incidents into five types based on their root causes and compile statistics on their distribution, then elucidate the vulnerable code and finance mechanisms exploited in each category. Subsequently, we identify the symptoms of codebased vulnerabilities and summarize the abstract attack models for the entire process. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art off-chain tools in detecting code-based vulnerabilities within their scope of capabilities. We find that Slither performs the best in detecting 22 % of temporal reentrancy vulnerabilities, and DeFiTainter has a 52% false negative rate in detecting price oracle manipulation, mainly attributed to three limitations.",

      "abstract": "The rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has brought novel financial opportunities but also exposed serious security vulnerabilities, with flash loans frequently exploited for price manipulation attacks. These attacks, leveraging the atomic nature of flash loans, allow malicious actors to manipulate DeFi protocol oracles and pricing mechanisms within a single transaction, causing substantial financial losses. Traditional smart contract analysis tools address some security risks but often struggle to detect the complex, inter-contract dependencies that make flash loan attacks challenging to identify. In response, we introduce FlashDeFier, an advanced detection framework that enhances static taint analysis to target price manipulation vulnerabilities arising from flash loans. FlashDeFier expands the scope of taint sources and sinks, enabling comprehensive analysis of data flows across DeFi protocols. The framework constructs detailed inter-contract call graphs to capture sophisticated data flow patterns, significantly improving detection accuracy. Tested against a dataset of high-profile DeFi incidents, FlashDeFier identifies 76.4% of price manipulation vulnerabilities, marking a 30% improvement over DeFiTainter. These results highlight the importance of adaptive detection frameworks that evolve alongside DeFi threats, underscoring the need for hybrid approaches combining static, dynamic, and symbolic analysis methods for resilient DeFi security.",

      "abstract": "Smart contracts in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms are attractive targets for attacks as their vulnerabilities can lead to massive amounts of financial losses. Flash loan attacks, in particular, pose a major threat to DeFi protocols that hold a Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding 106 billion. These attacks use the atomicity property of blockchains to drain funds from smart contracts in a single transaction. While existing research primarily focuses on price manipulation attacks, such as oracle manipulation, mitigating non-price flash loan attacks that often exploit smart contracts' zero-day vulnerabilities remains largely unaddressed. These attacks are challenging to detect because of their unique patterns, time sensitivity, and complexity. In this paper, we present FlashGuard, a runtime detection and mitigation method for non-price flash loan attacks. Our approach targets smart contract function signatures to identify attacks in real-time and counterattack by disrupting the attack transaction atomicity by leveraging the short window when transactions are visible in the mempool but not yet confirmed. When FlashGuard detects an attack, it dispatches a stealthy dusting counterattack transaction to miners to change the victim contract's state which disrupts the attack's atomicity and forces the attack transaction to revert. We evaluate our approach using 20 historical attacks and several unseen attacks. FlashGuard achieves an average real-time detection latency of 150.31ms, a detection accuracy of over 99.93%, and an average disruption time of 410.92ms. FlashGuard could have potentially rescued over \\405.71 million in losses if it were deployed prior to these attack instances. FlashGuard demonstrates significant potential as a DeFi security solution to mitigate and handle rising threats of non-price flash loan attacks.",

The emergence of flash loans has further amplified these risks, enabling increasingly complex oracle manipulation attacks that can lead to significant financial losses. Responding to this threat, we first dissect the attack mechanism by formalizing the standard operational and adversary models for PLFs. Based on our analysis, we propose SecPLF, a robust and practical solution designed to counteract oracle manipulation attacks efficiently. SecPLF operates by tracking a price state for each cryptoasset, including the recent price and the timestamp of its last update. By imposing price constraints on the price oracle usage, SecPLF ensures a PLF only engages a price oracle if the last recorded price falls within a defined threshold, thereby negating the profitability of potential attacks. Our evaluation based on historical market data confirms SecPLF's efficacy in providing high-confidence prevention against arbitrage attacks that arise due to minor price differences. SecPLF delivers proactive protection against oracle manipulation attacks, offering ease of implementation, oracle-agnostic property, and resource and cost efficiency.",

We propose a conceptual model for systemic risk formation in TradFi, grounded in well-established mechanisms such as leverage cycles, liquidity crises, and interconnected institutional exposures. Extending this analysis to DeFi, we identify unique structural and technological characteristics - such as composability, smart contract vulnerabilities, and algorithm-driven mechanisms - that shape the emergence and transmission of risks within decentralized systems. Through a conceptual mapping, we highlight risks with similar foundations (e.g., trading vulnerabilities, liquidity shocks), while emphasizing how these risks manifest and propagate differently due to the contrasting architectures of TradFi and DeFi. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of crosstagion, a bidirectional process where instability in DeFi can spill over into TradFi, and vice versa. We illustrate how disruptions such as liquidity crises, regulatory actions, or political developments can cascade across these systems, leveraging their growing interdependence. By analyzing this mutual dynamics, we highlight the importance of understanding systemic risks not only within TradFi and DeFi individually, but also at their intersection. Our findings contribute to the evolving discourse on risk management in a hybrid financial ecosystem, offering insights for policymakers, regulators, and financial stakeholders navigating this complex landscape.",

      "abstract": "It is stated that the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is transforming the financial industry because it provides its users with such services as lending, borrowing, trading, and insurance on decentralized terms using blockchain technology. DeFi is cheaper, transparent, and secure because it is developed on decentralized platforms, including Ethereum. But it is also encircled by such threats as regulatory risk, security risk and market risk. In this paper, the comparison of the DeFi and traditional financial systems will be presented involving such central capabilities of the DeFi as decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and lending platforms. It also mentions the discrepancies in rules, the positives of financial inclusions and the DeFi negatives such as volatility and absence of consumer protections. The paper gives a concluding look at what traditional institutions and regulators can do to react and cooperate with DeFi.",
